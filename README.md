# Rimworld-Mod-Template
A template mod, with the requirments and authors pre-set up, along with the necessary folders pre-made. Other important files and folders will be added ass they become necessary to making mods. Remember, you need to delete Published Field so a new ModId can form, and the about file will need to be re-written to work for your mod.

This mod is open source (note to self: make public sometime, after improving or some-such), so feel fre to use it without asking, as it's litterally just pre-set files that you could make yourself!
Oh, while the MIT liscense says you have to keep the liscense of anything based on it the same, I give you permission to change it if you so desire. I'm going to try to find a liscense without that requirment, but...
