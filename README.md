# Rimworld-Mod-Template
This "mod" is really just a template repository, designed to help with making rimworld mods, by haveing many useful folders pre-made, and an about file set up with common requirments. More useful additions comming soon!

## Explanation Locations
Useing this template is supposed to be (realitivly) self-explanitory, with placeholder files that explain what each folder is for. However , as I also tried to make them simple enough to be easy to see on most editors at a glance (many even built directly into the titles), a more in-depth [Explanation and Guide](https://github.com/Dynamic-Trio/Rimworld-Mod-Template/wiki) is here, along with more info.

A good amount of things here will need changeing. You will need to change the ID, the URL and such are examples, many of the requirments are put as hard ones, but are optional, there are comments in the about file, ect. For me, this mod is an almost exact copy & paste useage (almost as if it was originally made for my use...). I set up a security policy and a general issue template setup, however they will probaly need modifications to suit your use. Or, maybe not. But, this README file will definitly need modifications, and you might want to change the liscense, as the one I used is more "free" than normal
