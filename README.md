# Rimworld-Mod-Template
This "mod" is really just a template repository, designed to help with making rimworld mods, by haveing many useful folders pre-made, and an about file set up with common requirments. More useful additions comming soon!

## Explanation Locations
Useing this template is supposed to be (realitivly) self-explanitory, with placeholder files that explain what each folder is for. However , as I also tried to make them simple enough to be easy to see on most editors at a glance (many even built directly into the titles), a more in-depth [Explanation and Guide](https://github.com/Dynamic-Trio/Rimworld-Mod-Template/wiki) is here, along with more info.
### General Notes
1. you will need to edit some files, such as:
	1. Removing links to my stuff
 	2. Changeing Templates as needed
 	3. Altering Tags
  	4. Deleting unescessary folders
   	5. adding source code (if applicable)
   	6. Changeing README to fit your mod, not this current one
2. This template will get sporiadic, sometimes random, updates. Some add features, some just strictly are "what happens if I move this github file to here" or "how does this pull request type work?" 

# Notes
## [Drawbacks](https://github.com/Dynamic-Trio/Rimworld-Mod-Template/wiki/Pros-and-Cons#cons)
There are many drawbacks, the ones I know of noted bellow (more details at the linked part of the wiki)

1. constant changes/ [features](https://github.com/Dynamic-Trio/Rimworld-Mod-Template/wiki/Planned-Features) (hopefully improvments). As this is a template, once used, you can only get the improvements by manually brining in any changes
2. As it's a template, any updates won't go to mods already made with this, unless you manually download my changes
3. parts will need complete re-writes, unless you want to have a modID that duplicates with anyone who doesn't re-use it, and link to my server, and have an unrelated readme
4. it has hard requirements that you need to remove if not wanted
5. you still have to manually install source code and
6. there are many planned (and unplanned) features
7. I also use this as a testbed to see how different parts of GitHub works, so it might drastically break at any time
8. Explanation isn't that good (probally)
9. has many parts you probaly won't need, that you will need to manually prune
A good amount of things here will need changeing. You will need to change the ID, the URL and such are examples, many of the requirments are put as hard ones, but are optional, there are comments in the about file, ect. For me, this mod is an almost exact copy & paste useage (almost as if it was originally made for my use...). I set up a security policy and a general issue template setup, however they will probaly need modifications to suit your use. Or, maybe not. But, this README file will definitly need modifications, and you might want to change the liscense, as the one I used is more "free" than normal
