# Rimworld-Mod-Template
A template mod, with labels for what to put where, along with defaults for mods that I use as requirments (this started out soeley for me), but it shows what each folder is for, and explains in what the folder is for. A great place for designing the basis of your mod! (Note: much of the github stuff will probaly have to be changed, unless you like my issue templates and placeholder security policy)
