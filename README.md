# Rimworld-Mod-Template
A template mod, with the requirments and authors pre-set up, along with the necessary folders pre-made. Other important files and folders will be added ass they become necessary to making mods. Remember, you need to delete Published Field so a new ModId can form, and the about file will need to be re-written to work for your mod.

This mod is open source, so feel fre to use it without asking, as it's litterally just pre-set files that you could make yourself!
