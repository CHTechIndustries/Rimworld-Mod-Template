# Rimworld-Mod-Template
This "mod" is really just a template repository, designed to help with making rimworld mods, by haveing many useful folders pre-made, and an about file set up with common requirments. More useful additions comming soon!

## Explanation Locations
Useing this template is supposed to be (realitivly) self-explanitory, with placeholder files that explain what each folder is for. However , as I also tried to make them simple enough to be easy to see on most editors at a glance (many even built directly into the titles), a more in-depth [Explanation and Guide](https://github.com/Dynamic-Trio/Rimworld-Mod-Template/wiki) is here, along with more info.
### Edits
1. some files will need to be changed to match your needs
        1. Changeing template files as needed [^1]:
  	4. Deleting unescessary folders [^3]:
   	5. adding source code (if applicable) [^4]:
   	7. remove notes from mod [^6]
   	8. Format about file
   	    1. add URL (optional) or remove
   	    2. Altering Tags to match desired versions
   	    3. Changeing README to fit your mod, not this current one [^5]
3. This template will get sporiadic, sometimes random, updates. Some add features, some just strictly are "what happens if I move this github file to here" or "how does this pull request type work?" 

# Notes
There are some things you should note, including the fact that you will need to:
1. Remove files you don't want
2. alter templates
3. remove notes
4. change mod ID's
5. Remove the "common requirments" I put in that you don't use
6. Add in other mods you need
7. Change name
8. add URL (optional) or remove spot
9. Change Author
10. a whole lot more
## [Drawbacks](https://github.com/Dynamic-Trio/Rimworld-Mod-Template/wiki/Pros-and-Cons#cons)
There are many drawbacks, the ones I know of noted bellow (more details at the linked part of the wiki)

1. constant changes/ [features](https://github.com/Dynamic-Trio/Rimworld-Mod-Template/wiki/Planned-Features) (hopefully improvments). As this is a template, once used, you can only get the improvements by manually brining in any changes
2. As it's a template, any updates won't go to mods already made with this, unless you manually download my changes
3. parts will need complete re-writes, unless you want to have a modID that duplicates with anyone who doesn't re-use it, and link to my server, and have an unrelated readme
4. it has hard requirements that you need to remove if not wanted
5. you still have to manually install source code and
6. there are many planned (and unplanned) features
7. I also use this as a testbed to see how different parts of GitHub works, so it might drastically break at any time
8. Explanation isn't that good (probally)
9. has many parts you probaly won't need, that you will need to manually prune
10. Look at the "general notes" and "notes". most of those are kinda negative...
## [Benifits](https://github.com/Dynamic-Trio/Rimworld-Mod-Template/wiki/Pros-and-Cons#pros)
There are some benifits. The ones I can think of are:
1. Pre-made folders
2. useful templates pre-made
3. some security pre set-up
4. constant improvements (complete with [Planned Features](https://github.com/Dynamic-Trio/Rimworld-Mod-Template/wiki/Planned-Features))
