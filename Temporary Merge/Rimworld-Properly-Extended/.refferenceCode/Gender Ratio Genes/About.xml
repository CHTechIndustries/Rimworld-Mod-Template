	This mod adds a new pack of genes that change the gender ratio of that xenotype
	
	
Note from the porter: this great mod was made by Tuarre, all I (CTH2004) did was change a few things, and upload the port with permision.
Note from the porter 2: if you are using this mod, do not, I repeat, do not, use it with the original. The ID's are the same to allow for cross-compatibality, meaning youll have duplicates and errors galore!
Note from the porter 3: as this is a 1-for-1 port, I will only be fixing any bugs/ updateing to new versions (well, I might add a few extra goodies :). I do have plans (and permision) to integrate it with my mod, and there new features shall abound!
	Note from the porter 3a: this mod is officialy purely going to get bug fixes. It has been transfered into my main mod. See the workshop page (or the in-game changelog) for details. Do note, they are incompatible with each other, as I used the same ID's. In theory, you should be able to just transistion to the new one, but I don't recomend it.
		P.S: to other modders, you'll be happy to know that I marked the mods as incompatible because I kept the ID's the same, so, it shouldn't break your game!
