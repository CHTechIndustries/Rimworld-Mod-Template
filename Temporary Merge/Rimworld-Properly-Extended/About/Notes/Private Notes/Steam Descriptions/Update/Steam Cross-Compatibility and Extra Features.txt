So, this mod also adds new features to some mods (for details, look at the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/3114130835/4034726898984604842/]Features[/url] discussion). Currently, those mods are:

(Because of these 3, only the All in One's are compatible. The All in One's are a combination of multiple mods, so those individual ones are incompatible)
