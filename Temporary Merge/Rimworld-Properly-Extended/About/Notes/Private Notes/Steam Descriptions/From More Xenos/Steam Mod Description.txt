This realitivly simple mod is the basis of many enhancments to other mods. It starts with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3114130835]Rimworld Genes Extended
[/url]. That adds in new genes of my own design, as well as new genes based on other mods. Next, this mod (Xenotypes Expanded and Merged
), which is designed to patch many xenos to be integrated and more in-line with one another, as well as integrate in my previous mod. It also contains a few miscilaneus patches. The next parts of the series is explained more in Rimworld Genes Extended. But, all together, it makes many mods work seamlesly together! Perfect, eh?

Now, do note that the gene mod is a higher priority for feature-rich content, but this mod will still get [i]lots[/i] of updates!

A simplified list of xenotypes is over on [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/3097961901/4034727291141397072/]This discussion[/url], whereas the wiki has [url=https://github.com/Dynamic-Trio/More-Xenos/wiki/Created-Xenotypes]An in-depth page[/url] (WIP)
